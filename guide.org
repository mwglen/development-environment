* Set GRUB to Remember Last Selection
1. Put the following in ~/etc/default/grub~
   #+begin_src
   GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
   GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
   #+end_src

* Enable Hibernation
1. To enable hibernation, make sure that you have a swap partition. It is best to make the partition larger than the total amount of RAM on your system.
2. In ~/etc/default/grub~, add ~resume=/dev/nvme0n1p2~ to =GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=. Make sure to change "nvme0n1p2" with the name of your swap partition
3. Rebuild grub using the new config by running ~sudo grub-mkconfig -o ~/boot/grub/grub.cfg~
4. Reset your computer to complete the process

Now you can use ~sudo systemctl hibernate~ to hibernate and ~sudo systmectl hybrid-sleep~ to sleep. I recommend aliasing these to ~hibernate~ and ~hybrid-sleep~.

I also recommend changing the behavior of the system keys to all hibernate the computer

* Change Behavior of System Keys
1. In ~/etc/systemd/logind.conf~, edit =HandleSuspendKey=, =HandleHibernateKey=, =HandlePowerKey=, and =HandleLidSwitch=
2. Reset your computer to complete the process
